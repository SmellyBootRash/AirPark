# AirPark
KSP Mod to land vessel in atmosphere. Attach the airpark part located under the command and control tab to use. Toggle on to freeze vessel in place and mark it as landed to enable vehicle switching and toggle off to resume flight. Enable AutoPark to automatically unpark when attached inactive vessel is within 1.5 km of active vessel and automatically park when greater than 2 km away from the  active vessel. Use this feature to facilitate mid-air refueling or other shenanigans.
